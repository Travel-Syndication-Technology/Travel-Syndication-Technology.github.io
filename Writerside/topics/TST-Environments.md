# TST Environments

### Production

Production environment consists of two instances: Green and Blue, allowing for deployments of new releases to occur with zero downtime.

### Training

Training environment is kept in sync with Production, to allow for training and onboarding of new users in a stable environment.

### Preview (formerly UAT)

Preview is kept slightly ahead of the current Production Release, allowing users to test out new unreleased functionality that may be in its early stages of development.
